			<p class="h1-center">Tasks</p>
			<p class="normal">A task can be created or modified using the <b>
			Task&#39;s menu</b>.<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>General 
			tab</b></font><p class="normal"><b>Task name</b> - The name of the 
			task. This will be used many times on the log file and for the 
			compressed file names. You can leave the default ugly name or chose 
			an unique name to every task.<p class="normal"><b>Task ID</b> - A 
			unique identification to every task. You cannot modify this.&nbsp; 
			ID is only used internally by the program.<p class="normal"><b>
			Disabled</b> 
			- (Default unchecked) If this is checked, the task will be ignored 
			when backing up.<p class="normal"><b>Include subdirectories</b> - 
			(Default checked) If checked, when copying folders, it will also 
			recursively copy all the files in the subdirectories. 
			<p class="normal"><b>Create separated backups</b> - (Default 
			checked). If you select this check box, it will create a new file or 
			directory every time the item is copied. The date and time will be 
			used as a part of the new file name. Example: Item1 2002-01-11 ; 
			12;00.zip. If unchecked, the destination files will be overwritten<b>. 
			There is one disadvantage in overwriting the backups</b>: If the 
			backup fails for some reason in the middle of the operation, you 
			could end up having a bad backup , because the previous one will be 
			replaced by a bad one.<p class="normal">
			<b>Clear the archive attribute</b>: The program uses the archive bit 
			of the attribute of a file to decide which files must be copied when 
			the backup is differential or incremental. If you uncheck this 
			option the attributes will not be cleared. This is useful if you 
			want to have the same source in several different tasks.<p class="normal">
			<b>Use file attribute logic</b>: Sometimes, you cannot use the 
			archive attributes methods (for example, if the source is in a Linux 
			partition). In this case, you may want to uncheck this option. The 
			program will then compare the time stamps of the source and the 
			destination when making incremental or differential backups. This is 
			a very <b>LIMITED</b> solution: it won&#39;t work with archives or FTP 
			files.<p class="normal">
			%PROGRAMNAME% supports 4 types of tasks:<p class="normal"><b>Full 
			backups</b>: Every single file in the source will be copied or 
			compressed. If you are overwriting, every file will be replaced. If 
			Overwrite is unchecked, you will have several copies of the same 
			source.<p class="normal"><b>
			Incremental</b> -&nbsp; The program will check if the source has 
			been changed<font color="#FF0000"><b> from the last backup</b></font>. 
			If there is no need to copy the file, it will be skipped, saving 
			backup time. The incremental procedure checks the Archive bit 
			attribute of the file. You may want to manually reset the attribute 
			to force a full backup: use the &quot;Set the archive attributes&quot; on the 
			Task menu.<p class="normal">
			<b>Differential</b>: The program will check if the source has been 
			changed <b><font color="#FF0000">from the last FULL backup</font></b>. 
			If there is no need to copy the file, it will be skipped, saving 
			backup time. The differential procedure checks the Archive bit 
			attribute of the file. You may want to manually reset the attribute 
			to force a full backup: use the &quot;Set the archive attributes&quot; on the 
			Task menu.<p class="normal">
			<b>Dummy task</b>: This backup doesn&#39;t need a source or a 
			destination. It is useful to use the task just as an scheduler to 
			execute applications, close services, reboot the computer, etc.<p class="normal">
			<b>Full copies to keep</b>: If your backup is set to NOT overwrite 
			existing backups, every new backup will create a new file or 
			directory with the same name, but with the date and time of the 
			backup as a complement. 
			<p class="normal">For example: If the original file is SimCity.exe, 
			and the backup is NOT set to overwrite, every new backup will 
			create: </p>
			<p class="normal">SimCity.exe <br>
			SimCity 2003-04-13 12;22.exe <br>
			SimCity 2003-04-14 12;22.exe <br>
			SimCity 2003-04-15 12;22.exe , etc </p>
			<p class="normal">Now it&#39;s easy to maintain a limited number of FULL 
			copies of every backup and delete the old ones. On the backup 
			options you can set that you want, for example, maintain only 2 full 
			copies of the backup. <b>Note that if your task is incremental or 
			differential, the backup program will keep or delete the whole set 
			of 1 full backup plus its associated child backups every time it 
			deletes something</b>.</p>
			<p class="normal">The older backups will be deleted then. You can 
			always PARK a backup to prevent it from being deleted. This is 
			specially important for incremental backups when the first backup 
			will usually be full and the next backup only partial.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Make a full backup every</b>:&nbsp; If you have 
			scheduled a differential or incremental backup then you can program 
			it so, that every X backups will be made full. For example, if you 
			enter the number 3 here, then the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, etc backups 
			will be full. <font color="#FF0000"><b>This feature only works if 
			you are not overwriting your backups</b></font>.</p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Files tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Source</b> - Enter the files, directories 
			or/and FTP sources to backup. Please note that a backup FROM a FTP 
			must be full. Other backup types will be ignored and the backup will 
			made full. You must have enough space in the temporary directory to 
			download the whole FTP source if necessary.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Destination</b> - Enter the destination 
			directory, local or/and FTP . You can have multiple directories as 
			destinations. A copy of the backup will be placed on every 
			destination directory.</p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Schedule tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Backup type</b>: Select how often your backup 
			will be executed. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Once</b>: basically, this copies the file or 
			folder at the given date and time. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Daily</b>: backups the item every day at the 
			given time. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Weekly</b>: backups the item once a week at the 
			given day of the week. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Monthly</b>: backups the item once a month, at 
			the given day and time. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Yearly</b>: backups the task once a year, at 
			the given day and time.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Timer</b>: repeatedly backups the item every X 
			minutes. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Manual</b>: executes only if the user click on 
			Backup now. Not scheduled.</p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Archive tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Compression</b>: Choose the method of 
			compression to use (none, Zip or SQX)</p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF0000"><b>WARNING</b></font> - If 
			you are overwriting existing backups AND using compression, you will 
			obtain some king of mirror: if a file was deleted from the source, 
			it will be ALSO be deleted from the compressed backup. This will not 
			happen if the backup is uncompressed or if you are not overwriting.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Split the zip files in blocks</b>: If checked, 
			the final compressed archive will be split into blocks. Useful if 
			you want to backup the parts into removable media.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Archive&nbsp; comment</b>: Commentary to be 
			include into the archive</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Encryption type</b>: Choose the method to use 
			with encryption. </p>
			<p class="normal"><b><a href="compenc_en.htm">For more information 
			about compression and encryption click here</a>.</b></p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Special tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal">Here you can add a list of files/directories that 
			you can exclude or include into the backup. You can also use masks: 
			Example *.txt. </p>
			<p class="normal">Here you can exclude/include:</p>
			<p class="normal">1) Files. Just select the file with the &quot;Add file&quot; 
			button</p>
			<p class="normal">2) Directories: Just select a directory using the 
			&quot;Add directory&quot; button</p>
			<p class="normal">3) Enter a mask. You can use simply masks like 
			*.txt to exclude or include all the text files or you can use a 
			complex mask like </p>
			<p class="normal">*\Directory\*\*.txt</p>
			<p class="normal">This will include/exclude all the text files in 
			any path&nbsp; that contains a folder called Directory.</p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Events tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Before/After backup</b>: You can specify some 
			events that will occur before the backup starts and some events 
			after the backup ends. This can be convenient if you want to backup 
			some file that is in use by some application.<b> Before backup</b>, 
			close the other program and <b>after backup</b>, start it again. You 
			can <b>stop/start services </b>as well. </p>
			<p class="normal">You can close a program using the window's 
			caption (or a portion of it). In this version, you can also enter a window&#39;s 
			class name. This class name cannot be easily known but if you are a 
			programmer or an advanced user, you can use tools like Spy++ to get 
			the class name of some window. In this case you need to enter the 
			class name in the form:</p>
			<p class="normal">class:the_class_name</p>
			<p class="normal">including the word &quot;class:&quot; with the colon.</p>
			<p class="normal">If you are using the events &quot;Execute&quot; or &quot;Execute 
			and wait&quot; you can pass as parameters the source or the destination. 
			To do so:</p>
			<p class="normal">* Select the event and select the executable to 
			run.<br>
			* A dialog will be shown when you can enter some parameters. Here 
			you can enter any parameter you want, like a filename, etc. </p>
			<p class="normal">The files/directories will be passed using a 
			quoted string to avoid problems with long file names.</p>
			<p class="normal">You may need administrators rights to close some 
			programs or to start/stop services. </p>
			<p class="normal"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Advanced tab</b></font></p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Run the task as another user:</b> If your task 
			needs to access some resources for which you don&#39;t have permissions,&nbsp; 
			just select this option and enter the user name and password to use. 
			When the backup begins, the program will the try to logon as the 
			given user and logout when the task ends.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Abort if failed</b>: If the logon failed, just 
			abort the task and don&#39;t try to continue.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>ID</b>: name of the account</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Domain</b>: Domain name to which the user name 
			belongs. Enter a dot if the accounts belong to the local machine 
			only.</p>
			<p class="normal"><b>Password</b>: The password used to logon.</p>
