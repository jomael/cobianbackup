			<p class="normal">A <b>service</b> is a special windows application 
			that runs even if no user is logged on the system. The <b>service</b> 
			can run under a special account (<b>LocalSystem</b> account) or 
			under other existing account. On Windows NT, 2000 ,XP or 2003 is 
			recommended to run this program as a service. <b>You choose if you 
			want to run the program as a service or as an application in the 
			installation program.</b> You can also change the way the program 
			will work from the <b><a href="options_en.htm">Options</a></b> 
			dialog box.</p>
			<p class="normal">When running<b> %PROGRAMNAME%</b> as a <b>service</b>, 
			a problem can arise: <font color="#FF00FF"><b>if you want to access 
			a shared drive or folder or some non-local resource, you cannot run 
			the service under the default system account.</b></font>
			<font color="#FF00FF"><b>You must run it under an account which has 
			network access</b></font> (example: the Administrator account). In 
			the installation program, you can choose to configure the service to 
			run under the system or other account. </p>
			<p class="normal">Another difference is that <b>you cannot terminate 
			a service </b>the same way you close an application. You stop/start 
			a service using the Control Panel - Administrative tools - Services 
			icon. You can also control the service from the <b>
			<a href="options_en.htm">Options</a></b> dialog box.</p>
